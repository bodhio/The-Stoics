        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>

          The Stoics is an art project by the artist bodh.io to honour the practical philosophy of stoicism and to raise money for social impact. The artworks are hand drawn digitally by the artist, and are available in two mediums - NFTs and prints.
          <br>
          <br>
          The project has no utility besides the intrinsic value of owning the artwork and no roadmap besides the creation of the artworks of stoic philosophers.
